# Learning React by completing exercises

The aim to gain a good grasp of the [react library](https://react.dev/) by reading the docs, completing provided exercises and making up my own exercises. I will be aiming completely on the functionality rather than on styling. 

I already have some knowledge by making use of Salesforce [Lightning  Web Components](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/lwc/guide)  and [Lightning Aura componentsfrom](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/intro_components.htm) framework from my job that has helped better understand about react components. 

## Things That I learned
<ul>
  <li>What is JSX</li>
  <li>Create components and style them</li>
  <li>Passing props</li>
  <li>Nesting components</li>
  <li>Rendering lists</li>
  <li>Event handling and propagation</li>
  <li>How states work</li>
  <li>How updater functions work</li>
</ul>
